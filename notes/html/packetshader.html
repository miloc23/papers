GPU-Accelerated Software Router</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the work they present a software router framework that uses GPU to
accelerate packet processing. This kind of packet processing/forwarding
is highly parallelizable, so it can benefit greatly from the
architecture of GPU’s. They show that using PacketShader gives
substantially more performance than other software routing
solutions.</p>
<h2 id="opinion">Opinion</h2>
<p>This is an interesting paper with a good idea. The GPU is well suited
for a highly parallelizable task like packet routing. Each packet can be
sent on its way independently of other packets. The tricky part is in
creating interfaces to and from the GPU and NIC so that the benefits of
processing packets in parallel outweigh the overhead of the data
transfer and startup of GPU. They do a good job motivating the
bottlenecks and presenting their solutions to the problems. Their
evaluation seems like a good evaluation for synthetic tests.</p>
<h3 id="quality-as-a-paper">Quality as a Paper</h3>
<p>I think it is a mostly well written paper, but some of the
descriptions of their evalutaions were long and hard to get through. The
figures did a good job summarizing the data however which made up for
the fact. They never mentioned if they were the first to do this or if
they were making an improvement to an older idea.</p>
<h3 id="quality-as-an-idea">Quality as an Idea</h3>
<p>Really neat idea that seems very natural after reading the paper. Of
course packet routing is embarassingly parallelizalbe which makes it a
good fit for GPU.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-like-it">Do I like it</h3>
<p>Yes I like the paper. It is a nice idea combined with good
evaluations.</p>
<h2 id="what-problem-is-it-trying-to-solve">What Problem is it Trying to
Solve</h2>
<p>Software routers suffer from CPU bottlenecks for compute intensive
applications. Performance can be scaled up by adding more CPU cores to
the machine, but that is expensive. GPU compute provides a way to
increase performance in a cost effective way.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-their-approach-differ-from-previous-ones">How does
their approach differ from previous ones</h2>
<p>Their approach to software routing is significantly different from
previous ones. I think they were the first to apply GPU to the problem.
They also perform the packet processing in user-space as opposed to
kernel space.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-previous-work-do-i-know-about">How much previous work
do I know about</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-work">Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Yes! They see serious performance benefits from their system. I would
like to see how the numbers changed if they got rid of the IOH assymetry
they described.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-be-improved">What could be improved?</h2>
<ul>
<li>They could talk more about how they designed the interface for their
system to talk to the NIC and the GPU’s.</li>
<li>They could touch on if their approach could be applied to other
networking tasks that are not routing.</li>
<li>Could have more concrete comparisions to ASIC or other hardware
solutions for routing.</li>
<li>It would be interesting to see the evaluation results in a real
world situation where the rate of incoming packets may be variable or
come in bursts. Combine this with resource utilization and compare to
just using CPU or other solutions.</li>
</ul>
