benefits and costs of writing a POSIX kernel in a high level programming
language</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This paper is about writing a POSIX compatible kernel using the high
level language Go. The authors found that using a high level language
made programming the system subjectively easier, and also worked to
avoid some number of safety bugs in the kernel. However, they also found
that the performance was not as good as using a language like C.
Depending on the use case of the kernel, using a high level language may
be appropriate for programming a kernel.</p>
<h2 id="opinion">Opinion</h2>
<p>I liked the paper. It does a good job motivating why the use of Go is
an interesting choice for writing a kernel. The POSIX compatibility part
was interesting because it allowed a better comparision between Biscuit
and Linux. The authors could have motivated why they were writing the
kernel in Go a bit better. They claim that it reduces a class of bugs
which is great, but it feels like there should be more reasons.</p>
<p>They had a really great section dealing with the evaluation of their
system.</p>

Solve</h2>
<p>The paper is investigating whether or not it is feasible to write a
POSIX kernel using a high level langauge. Traditional operating system
implementation wisdom says that it is not feasible for performance
reasons and interface reasons. Some high level languages are difficult
to bend to handle the low level details needed for a kernel. But others
can do that, and they provide features that C does not such as garbage
collection or other memory safety features.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-their-approach-differ-from-previous-ones">How does
their approach differ from previous ones</h2>
<p>They used Go for their programming language.</p>
<p>They also used a static analysis method to better determine how much
memory syscalls would need to be allocated to help reduce teh amount of
performance overhead that GC has.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-work">Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Yes. The system can run real applications that are useful. It does
pay a performance penalty, and I’m not sure if the gains from using Go
make that penalty worthwhile. The authors do note that some of the
performance differential is simply due to optimizations that were made
in Linux kernel that were not implemented in Biscuit for no technical
reason. The system also requires significantly extra memory in order to
function best. The authors claim something like 2 to 3 times extra heap
memory.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-be-improved">What could be improved?</h2>
<p>More optimzations could be made in the system to improve it.</p>
<p>To me it seems like if we are using a high level language, we should
be doing something other than just trying to make it C. Maybe this means
moving away from POSIX compatibility, but there should be some draw to
using Go. I get that the bugs are ever present in C code bases, but it
always struck me as odd or not as important. For example, there were
also bugs present in the Go packages? Can we ever really get away from
these bugs? I should learn more about how bad these bugs can be.</p>
