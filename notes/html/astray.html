Kernels are Leading OS Research Astray</h1>
<p>P. Druschel, V. S. Pai and W. Zwaenepoel, “Extensible kernels are
leading OS research astray,” Proceedings. The Sixth Workshop on Hot
Topics in Operating Systems (Cat. No.97TB100133), Cape Cod, MA, USA,
1997, pp. 38-42, doi: 10.1109/HOTOS.1997.595179.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Extensible operating systems seek to solve three main problems: 1.
improve performance without giving up safety, 2. make deploying new OS
innovations easier, and 3. managing OS complexity. Current
implementations of extensible operating systems do not reach this goal
because they put their attention in the wrong place. They focus on
making kernel extensions safe so that they can be deployed, but they
never end up doing anything for the three main ideas. Instead of
creating extensible operating systems for end use, the research
community should create extensible operating systems that serve as a
quick way to test and design new operating system features/ideas that
can then be implemented in other operating systems in a non-extensible
way.</p>
<h2 id="opinion">Opinion</h2>
<p>I think the introduction is really good. It clearly outlines a
potential problem, analyzes why it is a problem, and then presents a
solution. I agree that the problem they talk about is real and valid at
the time, and I think it may be even more valid today. The operating
system market is even more constrained now, so improvements to existing
OS are much more likely to occur than a new OS entering the market. So
much software has been created for these OS that it is hard to imagine
how a big paradigm shift, such as the kinds of extensible operating
systems presented, could even happen.</p>
<p>Section 2 loses me a bit. I understand that they want to motivate
their idea, but it feels disconnected. They are trying to say that a
fully generalizable extension framework is not necessary for achieving
the stated performance goals of extensible operating systems. I think
they do need to consider this aspect, and they do motivate why we don’t
need the general extensions, but they don’t connect it to the idea of a
research focused extensible operating system. It feels like they shift
gears fully from one idea to another idea. In my opinion they shift away
from the interesting idea to a much less interesting idea before fully
exploring the first idea.</p>
<p>Section 2 needed to be about using an extensible operating system to
develop some non-general extension, a deeper analysis of other existing
extensible operating systems, or something like that instead of an
analysis of a current problem. Definitely the problem they look at was
targeted by extensible operating systems, but that does not build the
case they present in the introduction.</p>
<h3 id="quality-as-a-paper">Quality as a Paper</h3>
<p>To me the paper feels like two papers stapled together. The
connection between the first and second section is not clear enough.
Section 2 does address a real issue, but it just doesn’t connect to
section 1 well enough for me.</p>
<h3 id="quality-as-an-idea">Quality as an Idea</h3>
<p>The idea of using extensible operating systems as a research tool
instead of a production system is a really good idea. We can skip trying
to solve the extremely difficult problem of making user-supplied
inherently non-safe code safe. Instead, we get to focus on the important
problems in OS design and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-like-it">Do I like it</h3>
<p>I don’t like the paper as a paper. It does not present a cohesive
enough story.</p>
<h2 id="what-problem-is-it-trying-to-solve">What Problem is it Trying to
Solve</h2>
<p>The paper is trying to solve the problem of many extensible operating
systems being created that do not really solve or improve on any of the
goals that extensible operating systems are supposed to solve.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-their-approach-differ-from-previous-ones">How does
their approach differ from previous ones</h2>
<p>They suggest shifting the positioning of extensible operating systems
from a product in themselves, to a tool for researchers to investigate
OS design and implementation concepts. Improvements generated using
these extensible operating systems could then be incorporated in
non-extensible operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-previous-work-do-i-know-about">How much previous work
do I know about</h2>
<p>I’ve read SPIN, and have some familiarity with the kind of
packet-filters they talk about.</p>
